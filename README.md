# DevX 1.0 🚀 *AI-Augmented Software Development Platform*

## Overview
DevX is transforming the way engineering teams build, debug, and optimize software. This platform demonstrates an AI-powered development workflow that leverages LlamaIndex to coordinate two advanced models: GPT-4o-mini for analyzing user input, and O3-Mini for tasks such as design, coding, DevOps, and more.

> ✨ Think of it as your Dev Co-Pilot—customizable, extensible, and ready.

## Key Features
- Multi-agent, event-driven architecture
- AI-assisted generation of user stories, designs, code, DevOps configurations, and test cases
- Feedback-driven refinement at every stage of the software development lifecycle
